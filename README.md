# Graz Glasses

This project simulates a pyramid of equally sized wine glasses stacked on top of each other, where the water flows from the top glass downwards. The simulation starts by filling the top glass, which overflows into the glasses beneath it once it is full.

The first glass takes 10 seconds to fill before it starts overflowing. The program calculates the time it takes for any specified glass in the pyramid to overflow, providing results with three decimal point accuracy.
